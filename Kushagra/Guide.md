## Step by step guide towards github

## What is Github!!
GitHub is a highly used software which is typically used for version control. It is helpful when more than just one person is working on a project. Say for example, a software developer team wants to build a website and everyone has to update their codes simultaneously while working on the project. In this case, Github helps them to build a centralized repository where everyone can upload, edit and manage the code files. Github has many advantages over other cloub based sites like dropbox. Github document the changes and reflect them in an organized manner to avoid any chaos between any of the files uploaded.

## How Github Works!!
GitHub is a Git repository hosting service, which provides a web-based graphical interface. It helps every team member to work together on the project from anywhere and makes it possible for them to work collaboratively.
It is used widely by software developers as it allows them to store source codes for a project and track the complete history of all changes to that code. There are millions of repositories on GitHub and each repository has its own tools to help you host and release code.
GitHub helps all the team members to stay on the same page and stay organized. Moderation tools like issue and pull request locking help the team to focus on the code. GitHub is one place where project managers and developers coordinate, monitor, and update their work so projects stay transparent and on time.
Pull requests help the teams to review, improve, and propose new codes on GitHub. The implementations and proposals can be discussed before changing the source code.
The packages can be published privately, or within the team or publicly for the open-source community. The packages can be used or reused by downloading it from the GitHub.
GitHub uses tools to identify and analyze vulnerabilities to the code, that other tools tend to miss. Development teams everywhere work together to secure the software supply chain, from fork to finish.

## Cloning
Cloning a GitHub repository creates a local copy of the remote repo. This allows you to make all of your edits locally rather than directly in the source files of the origin repo.

## Forking
A fork is a copy of a repository that allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project. A forked repository differs from a clone in that a connection exists between your fork and the original repository itself. In this way, your fork acts as a bridge between the original repository and your personal copy where you can contribute back to the original project using Pull Requests.

## What is PR
PR--> PR stands for pull request, A pull/merge request is submitted when you’ve worked on some code from a particular branch and want to inform the others of the changes you’ve made. A person/people can be assigned to review and subsequently approve the request before your changes can be incorporated into the branch. Users can give their contributions in the world of open source projects.

## How to make a PR
Fork the Repository-->Clone the Repository-->Create a new branch [ master branch may also be used]-->commit ur changes localy-->Update ur local repo-->push the changes-->create the PR on github

## What is a branch
in layman's term we can say that git branches are individual projects within a git repository...all the branches are independant of each other. There is default 'Master' branch in git. Once we have made changes to a project we can merge that particular branch to the master branch. It is used mainly to reduce redundancy in the project

## What are issues?
Issues shown in github is the way to track the problems while using the code in repository. Anybody use the code can raise issues and responsible people will take it forward to fix the problem after verifying. It can also be used to keep track of tasks, enhancements for the code base.

## How to open an issue?
-->On GitHub Enterprise, navigate to the main page of the repository.
-->Under your repository name, click  Issues.
-->Click New issue.
-->Type a title and description for your issue.
-->If you're a project maintainer, you can assign the issue to someone, add it to a project board, associate it with a milestone, or apply a label.
-->When you're finished, click Submit new issue.
